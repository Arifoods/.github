# 🌿 Arifoods SA – Where Mediterranean flavors meet open source

Welcome to **Arifoods SA**, the GitHub home of creators, maintainers, and visionaries who believe in clean code, taste, and authenticity. Just like [Arifoods SA](https://arifoods.gr) crafts premium antipasti with Greek flair and global reach, we build projects with precision, quality, and community in mind.

## 🍇 Our Mission

We believe:

- In _craftsmanship_ — same way Arifoods picks top-tier ingredients, we pick robust tools, solid architecture, and maintainable design.  
- In _local roots & global reach_ — from Greek inspiration to serving 29 countries, Arifoods marries heritage and expansion. We aim for that balance in our projects: local context, global impact. ([arifoods.gr](https://arifoods.gr))  
- In _sustainability & quality_ — Arifoods’ focus on preserving nutritional value and respecting safety protocols echoes our dedication to clean code, security, and developer ergonomics. ([arifoods.gr](https://arifoods.gr))
